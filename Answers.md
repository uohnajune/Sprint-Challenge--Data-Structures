Question 1: Oder of instertions/removal
For Stack data structures are LIFO (last in first out), Queue data structures are FIFO (First in first out).

Question 2: Time complexity comparisons
Linked List = O(N) for access and searching
              O(1) for insertion and deletions

Hash Table = O(1) for search, insertion, and deletions

Binary Search Trees = O(log N) for searching, accesssing, deleting or inserting

Big O notations: a way to measure how well a computer alogrithms scales as the                     amount of data increases

O(1) = time to complete independent of size input set or amount of data
O(log N) = time to complete is proportional to the log of the input size
O(N) = time to complete would be in direct proportional to size of object
O(NxN) = time to complete equal to square of number of items
O(N!) = time to complete proportional to the factorial of input set
